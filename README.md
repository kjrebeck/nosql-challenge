# Eat Safe, Love: Food Hygiene Rating Analysis

## Project Description

This project involved setting up a MongoDB database and using multiple Jupyter Notebooks to manipulate and analyze the data. The exploratory analysis involved querying the database to answer specific questions about UK food establishments then analyzing and visualizing the results using Pandas DataFrames.
